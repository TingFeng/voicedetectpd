Detecting Parkinson's disease from voice recordings

This is my project in Insight Health Data Science Fellows Program. It is a collaboration work with Sage Bionetworks. Many thanks to Larsson Omberg and Andrew Trister from Sage Bionetworks and everyone in the Insight family!

A little bit of history about the project:

In collaboration with Apple, Sage Bionetworks developed a consenting and communication protocols for communicating Personal Health Information (PHI) as it is collected from Apple Research Kit enabled apps.  They currently have five mobile health clinical trials enrolling hundreds of thousands of patients. One of these apps, is used to track Parkinson patients by collecting longitudinal measurements of Parkinson progression including fine motor dexterity through taping tests, gait measurements from accelerometers readings and vocal dexterity from voice recordings.

My task includes: 1) to help extract meaningful features from over 10 thousand voice recordings 2) to show that my feature extraction works by building predictive models.
